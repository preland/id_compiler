# Inherently Determinable Compiler (idc)

> Seriously? *Another* coding language? Why?

Yes. If I believed there was a better option for my use cases, I would've chosen it. Sadly, here we are. Modern programming languages were not built for usage in the era of LLMs, and this is a serious issue. LLMs are undeniably powerful, but they are undeniably dense, and undeniably sycophantic and deceptive in nature. It is *cool* that we today can "vibe code" an entire web interface mockup with nothing but humanlike writing, but that is all that it is: *cool*. It is yet to become genuinely *useful* in most applications. From my own personal experience over the past year, attempting to utilize LLMs into my workflows, the main challenge of utilizing them is that they generate believeable code outputs, but do so in such a large quantity that it becomes difficult to follow their reasoning and to understand the output well enough to be able to rapidly make changes. Some of this complexity is inherent to the code being written, and is simply a part of working on modern codebases. **Much of it is not**.

The goal of the Inherently Determinable language (id, pronounced "ihd") is to make a simple and strictly formatted language capable of both low and high level programming, pursuant to creating code that is more maintainable, easier to read and understand, and much more difficult to use to hide complexity.
