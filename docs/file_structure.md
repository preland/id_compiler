# File Structure

Each file in id has at most 3 combined functions and objects. If it has more than this allotment, that is a compiler error. A file may also have a flag command on its first line and on consecutive lines in the case of multiple flags. If a flag is invalid, or is misplaced within the file, that is a compiler error.
